I have developed a pub package in Dart that provides an elegant solution to the common challenge
faced when using
GridView Builder: the need to manually adjust the gridDelegate to achieve a responsive layout.
With this package, your grid layouts become effortlessly responsive, as the gridDelegate adjusts
itself automatically.
This means you no longer have to fine-tune parameters like the number of columns or the aspect
ratio,
saving you time and effort in the development process.
This tool streamlines the creation of dynamic grid layouts, making it easier for developers to
create visually appealing and responsive designs without the hassle of manual adjustment

## Features


## Getting started

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package.

## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder.

```dart

///Example
//before
GridView.builder(
gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
crossAxisCount: 2, // Number of columns
mainAxisSpacing: 8.0, // Spacing between rows
crossAxisSpacing: 8.0, // Spacing between columns),
itemCount: items.length,
itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
return Card(
child: Center(
child: Text(items[index]),),); },);

//after
GridView.builder(
gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCountAndFixedHeight(
crossAxisCount: 2, // Number of columns
mainAxisSpacing: 8.0, // Spacing between rows
crossAxisSpacing: 8.0, // Spacing between columns),
itemCount: items.length,
itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
return Card(
child: Center(
child: Text(items[index]),),); },);
